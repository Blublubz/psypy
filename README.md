This repository contains tasks written in Python using PsychoPy

c-m_oddball is a cross-modal oddall task (might not work)

SART is a sustained attention to response task and a vigilance task

There are two serial-recall tasks with vibratory distractors (specially built vibrating handles)

Cross-modality matching was also used with vibrations and sounds.

Local-global task is a switching task

SART and the Local-global task are free to use. Be sure to pilot them and let me know if they do work as intended.

The other tasks requires equipment that are not available outside our lab.
